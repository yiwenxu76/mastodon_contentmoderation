__Final Retrospective__

This is the first time that I design, implement, and demonstrate a project on my own. Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in working with external API and processing large set of data. I learned about the Mastodon API and how to use it to fetch public statuses by reading documents, as well as how to filter and search through the statuses for specific keywords. Additionally, I improved my skills in writing clean and modular code, as I divided the program into separate functions with clear and concise inputs and outputs.

I like the project particularly because it is related to my previous work experience, I used to run the operations side of online community content moderation, now I take part in building the program myself. One aspect of the project that I enjoyed was the challenge of working with a new API and learning its various functions and parameters. It was satisfying to see the program successfully fetch and filter statuses based on specific criteria. In the meantime, I struggled with some aspects of the project, particularly in figuring out how to set up and run the Mastodon API calls. Originally I wanted to use Tweety to fetch tweets on Twitter, but later I found out that Twitter does not have free version of API available anymore, so I had to spend more time on familiarizing myself with the Mastodon platform. I also spent extra time testing the code and finding ways to handle potential errors in a robust manner.

Moving forward, I can work on further improving my error handling skills and being more proactive in anticipating potential errors that may arise in the code. Moreover, I should focus on building more advanced applications that involve multiple APIs and more complex data processing techniques. This project has shown me the importance of being able to work with external APIs and integrating them into my projects, which will be invaluable in my future as a programmer.
